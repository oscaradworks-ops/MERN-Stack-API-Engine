Some issues that i had to solve in this project------->


✔️My server.js file was trying to execute the data base before the variables of the env load the procces
-----------------------------------------
   ✅ Solution= reorder the dotenv code line:
   require('dotenv').config(); (This line should be the first onee in the "server.js" file)
-----------------------------------------

✔️Make sure the file .env is writed ✅"MONGODB_URI" instead "MONGODB_URL"
------------------------------------------

✔️ Other 
MongoDB connection failed: bad auth : authentication failed
[nodemon] app crashed - waiting for file changes before starting...

this was for a problem in the database "user pasword"needed to be updated and repaced in the .env file... RESULT:

PORT=3000
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://webartistdesign_db_user:*NewPasswordHere*@oscardb.uhazsl9.mongodb.net/


--------------------------------------------------
✔️ Other 
Postman had troubles Posting my json file because the actual ip adress needed to be actualized in mongo db atlas under / Security/Data Base and Network Acess/ IP Access List
Issue solved ✅ We got the post! (I think it was my antivirus VPN)

**Nodemon acualize the changes in the .js files automatically so that was a big help**
**sing MongoDB for VS Code extention for vscode was helpfull too**
